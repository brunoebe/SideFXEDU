"""This node illustrates how the Portal Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS) Bias works."""

WARNING:
    This node is made for education purposes only. 
    You can use it for other things, but at your own risks.

The Portal MIS Bias controls whether the dome light is more likely to sample from the environment map or the portal geometry.

@parameters

    Texture Map:
        #id: filename
        The HDRI file map
        
    Use HDA Dome Light:
        #id: switchif_use_internal_domelight
        Use the dome light geometry shipped with the HDA instead of input 1.
        
    Use HDA Portal:
        #id: switchif_use_internal_portal
        Use the portal geometry shipped with the HDA instead of input 2.
        
    Use HDA Prim Hits:
        #id: switchif_use_internal_primhits
        Use the primary hit points geometry shipped with the HDA instead of input 3.
        
    Prim hits to keep (%):
        #id: select1
        Percentage of primary hit points to keep. Saves computation time when "Do Single Prim Hit" is OFF.
        
    Do Single Prim Hit:
        #id: dosingleprimhit
        When ON, use only one primary hit point (which you can chose with the next parameter: singleprimhit)
        
    Use Single Prim Hit:
        #id: singleprimhit
        Chose which of the primary point for which to simulate the rays.
        
    Portal MIS Bias:
        #id: portalmisbias
        Controls whether the dome light is more likely to sample from the environment map or the portal geometry.
        This simulates the Portal MIS Bias available on the Dome Light LOP, but it's not using the same mathematical model as Karma. This is an example whose sole purpose is to illustrate how the ray distribution is balanced when adjusting this parameter.
        
    Show Dome Light:
        #id: show_dome
        Show/hide the dome light geometry.
        
    Show behing portal:
        #id: show_dome_behind_portal
        Show/hide the part of the dome light geometry that is not seen through the portal geometry.
