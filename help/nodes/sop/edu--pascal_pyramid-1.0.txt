@parameters

    == General ==

    Layers:
        #id: nblayers
        The number of layers of the pyramid.
        
    Color Seed:
        #id: seed
        Change the color seed used to randomize the numbers' colors.
        
    Show wires:
        #id: input
        Show/Hide the wires of the pyramid.
        
    == Matching ==

    Justify X/Y/Z:
        Controls how the each axis is translated to match the
        reference box.
        
        None:
            No movement on the x-axis
        Min:
            The minimum of the object's bounding box is aligned to the minimum of the reference's bounding box.
        Center:
            The center of the object's bounding box is aligned to the center of the reference's bounding box.
        Max:
            The maximum of the object's bounding box is aligned to the maximum of the reference's bounding box.

    To:
        Controls which axis of the reference box the object is justified to.
        
        Same:
            Matches the justification of reference: so the minimum will match minimum, or center match center.
        Min:
            The justification side of the object's bounding box is aligned to the minimum of the reference's bounding box.
        Center:
            The justification side of the object's bounding box is aligned to the center of the reference's bounding box.
        Max:
            The justification side of the object's bounding box is aligned to the maximum of the reference's bounding box.

    Offset by:
        Additional offset to apply to the justification.  This allows for a
        fixed-size gap, or fixed-size overlap to be specified.
