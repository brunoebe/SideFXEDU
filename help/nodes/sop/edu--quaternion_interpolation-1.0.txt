"""This node visualizes the interpolation between two quaternions, as well as their effect on the input objects."""

WARNING:
    This node is made for education purposes only. 
    You can use it for other things, but at your own risks.

NOTE:
    This HDA is a support tool for a quaternion course to be release in a near future on Houdini Insight.

Visualize a plane containing the quaternion and origin from the 4D quaternion space to help illustrate interplation.

For any rotation and scale there are two quaternions that can describe it, q, and -q.  These are represented by orange and gray dots respectively.

The green dot represents the quaternion generated from interpolating the two input quaternions and ultimately used to rotate the geometry.


@parameters

    == Create Quaternion ==

    Axis:
        #id: axis
        Axis used to build the quaternion.
        
    === Quaternion 1 ===

    Angle:
        #id: angle1
        Angle used to build the first quaternion.
        
    Scale:
        #id: scale1
        Scale used to build the first quaternion.
        
    Negate:
        #id: negate1
        Use this checkbox to negate the first quaternion.
        
    Interpolation:
        #id: interpolation
        How to interpolate between the two quaternions.
        
        None: No interpolation. In this mode, quaternion 2 parameters are deactivated.
            
        Linear: Interpolates linearly between the two quaternions.
            
        Spherical: Interpolates spherically between the two quaternions.
            
    Bias:
        #id: bias
        The bias of the interpolation.
        
    === Quaternion 2 ===

    Shortest Path:
        #id: shortestpath
        Whether to use the closest or farthest quaternion to interpolate with.
        
    Angle:
        #id: angle2
        Angle used to build the second quaternion.
        
    Scale:
        #id: scale2
        Scale used to build the second quaternion.
        
    Negate:
        #id: negate2
        Use this checkbox to negate the second quaternion.
        
    === Output ===

    Quaternion:
        #id: quaternion
        This parameter is used to visualize the resulting quaternion values.
