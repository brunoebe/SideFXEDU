"""This node visualizes the interpolation between two quaternions, as well as their effect on the input objects."""

This HDA is a support tool for a quaternion course to be release in a near future on Houdini Insight.
It visualizes the quaternion, and its opposite, based on the values the user inputs.
It's also possible to define a second quaternion to interpolate with, and see the effect of linear as well as spherical interpolation.

@parameters

    == Create Quaternion ==

    Axis:
        #id: axis
        Axis used to build the quaternion.
        
    === Quaternion 1 ===

    Angle:
        #id: angle1
        Angle used to build the first quaternion.
        
    Scale:
        #id: scale1
        Scale used to build the first quaternion.
        
    Negate:
        #id: negate1
        Use this checkbox to negate the first quaternion.
        
    Interpolation:
        #id: interpolation
        How to interpolate between the two quaternions.
        
        None: No interpolation. In this mode, quaternion 2 parameters are deactivated.
            
        Linear: Interpolates linearly between the two quaternions.
            
        Spherical: Interpolates spherically between the two quaternions.
            
    Bias:
        #id: bias
        The bias of the interpolation.
        
    === Quaternion 2 ===

    Shortest Path:
        #id: shortestpath
        Whether to use the closest or farthest quaternion to interpolate with.
        
    Angle:
        #id: angle2
        Angle used to build the second quaternion.
        
    Scale:
        #id: scale2
        Scale used to build the second quaternion.
        
    Negate:
        #id: negate2
        Use this checkbox to negate the second quaternion.
        
    === Output ===

    Quaternion:
        #id: quaternion
        This parameter is used to visualize the resulting quaternion values.
