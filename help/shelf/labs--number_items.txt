""" Attach a numbered background image to the selected items in the network, and create a quickmark. """

This tool attaches numbers as background images to the selected nodes, and create quickmark to quickly navigate through these items.
This is useful when you want to highlight important steps in a network.

    You cannot navigate them with the numbers on your keyboard.
